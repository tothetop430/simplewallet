Project Overview:

I have a project involving the automation of the item transfer process within an Android application. The processes include deposit and withdrawal of chips for club members. The primary goal is to seamlessly handle these transactions while considering security measures, dynamic app element changes, and potential errors. Do let me know if you can truly handle this completely and successfully and I would send the project requirements afterward.

Project Requirements:

Deposit Process:
Input: {user id, amount of chips}
Bot searches for the player using the provided ID and sends chips.
Error handling for scenarios like insufficient balance or player not found.

Withdrawal Process:
Input: {user id, amount of chips}
Bot searches for the player using the provided ID and retrieves chips.
Error handling for scenarios like insufficient balance or player not found.

Security Measures:
Implementation of measures to avoid detection by the application's security team.
Handling dynamic changes in app element IDs.

API Deployment:
End product should be a bot deployed as an API.

there will be only two process (withdrawal and deposit) no more accept user
